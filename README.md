# Binary Search Trees
A project that provides hands-on practice on the implementation of Binary Search Trees structure.

## Data Structures and Algorithms Project
## Introduction

This Java project is an implementation of a binary search tree (BST) data structure. The BST allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of items in a sorted collection. The project includes core functionalities such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before getting started with this project, you will need to have a working knowledge of programming concepts and basic data structures such as trees. Additionally, you will need to have a programming environment set up with a compatible language, such as Python, C++, or Java.

### Installation

To get started with this project, you can read the tasks of the project written in the attached "Tasks.pdf" and start implementing based on the given guidelines. You can also use the text files to scan the input and check your work. [Tasks.pdf](https://github.com/bmzantout/Binary-Search-Trees/files/11221044/Tasks.pdf)


## Contributing
