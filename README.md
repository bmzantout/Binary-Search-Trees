# Binary-Search-Trees
This Java project is a group project implemented in collaboration with my colleague.

## Data Structures and Algorithms Project
## Introduction

This Java project is an implementation of a binary search tree (BST) data structure. The BST allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of items in a sorted collection. The project includes core functionalities such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal.

## Usage

To run the project, simply run the `Main.java` file. This file contains a sample implementation of a binary search tree, along with some sample data for demonstration purposes. The output will show the contents of the tree before and after various operations are performed on it.
